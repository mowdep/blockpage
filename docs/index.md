# Welcome

PiPass is an add-on to the Pi-Hole project which adds a blockpage and an ability to temporarily unblock websites which should not be blocked. The wiki is currently being developed and some pages have content, and some do not. Please bear with us as the wiki takes shape.<br/>

This project is the result of [@roenw](https://github.com/roenw)'s original work, with community support along the way. Community contributions by people like you keep this project alive.
