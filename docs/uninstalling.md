# Uninstalling
We will miss you, but we want to make this an easy breakup.

To uninstall, execute the following command in the Terminal:
``bash <(wget -qO- https://sputnik.roen.us/pipass/scripts/uninstall.sh)``

If you are experiencing any issues with the uninstaller, you can create an issue to let us know.

## Feedback
