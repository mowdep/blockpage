# Wiki Contributions

To contribute to the PiPass Wiki, simply fork the [PiPass repository](https://github.com/roenw/PiPass) and checkout the ``docs`` branch. Make your edits, and create a pull request. When your contributions are pulled into the main repository, the public wiki will be rebuilt soon after and your changes will go live.

## MkDocs

PiPass uses MkDocs as its wiki provider. MkDocs generates visually appealing static HTML pages from Markdown.

## Markdown

Markdown is the syntax that is used to build the wiki. You can learn more about how to use it [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).
